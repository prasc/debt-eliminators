            <p>
              Frank Kumi grew up in Toronto playing competitive soccer and
              basketball. Frank was drawn into the rehabilitation community
              after going through several injuries himself. After completing his
              Bachelor of Science Degree in Kinesiology from York University,
              Frank obtained a Master of Science Degree in Physical Therapy from
              Queen’s University. Frank has furthered his clinical education by
              completing courses on Post-Concussion Management, Level 1 Manual
              Therapy, Soft Tissue Release, Acupuncture, and Pain Neuroscience
              education.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frank encourages an active approach to treatment by providing his
              clients with the education and exercises necessary to take control
              of their injury, as well as supplementing it with manual therapy
              as needed. As a lover of sports, you can find Frank playing
              basketball, soccer, volleyball, or working out when not at the
              clinic. Frank looks forward to building a strong therapeutic
              alliance with his clients and empowering them to achieve their
              goals! Frank has furthered his clinical education by completing
              courses in post-concussion management, vestibular rehabilitation,
              manual therapy, and acupuncture.
